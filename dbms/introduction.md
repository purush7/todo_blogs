Database is collection of data in a way so that it helps in efficient retrieval,insertion and deletion

### What is DBMS?

A database management system (DBMS) is a software application that interacts with the user, other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data. A DBMS allows you to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data in a database. It also provides facilities for controlling access to the database, enforcing data integrity, and recovering the database in the event of failures.

- Data modeling: The process of designing a database involves creating a data model, which is a conceptual representation of the data and the relationships between different data elements.
- Data schema: A database schema is the structure or blueprint of a database, which defines the organization, structure, and types of data that are stored in the database.
- Data independence: A DBMS should provide data independence, which means that the database can be changed without affecting the applications that use it.
- Transaction management: A DBMS should provide facilities for managing transactions, which are units of work that are either completed in their entirety or not completed at all.
- Concurrency control: In a DBMS with multiple users, concurrency control is used to manage access to the database and ensure that data is consistent and accurate.
- Data security: A DBMS should provide mechanisms for protecting the database from unauthorized access and ensuring the privacy of data.


### There are four types of Data Languages

- Data Definition Language (DDL)
- Data Manipulation Language(DML)
- Data Control Language(DCL)
- Transactional Control Language(TCL)

DDL is the short name for Data Definition Language, which deals with database schemas and descriptions, of how the data should reside in the database.

- CREATE: to create a database and its objects like (table, index, views, store procedure, function, and triggers)
- ALTER: alters the structure of the existing database
- DROP: delete objects from the database
- TRUNCATE: remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed
- COMMENT: add comments to the data dictionary
- RENAME: rename an object
